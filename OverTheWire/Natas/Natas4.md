## Logic
Here the hint is that they say “Not even Google will find it this time…” when we view source. The file they are referring to is *robots.txt* and robots.txt is *disallowing crawlers to find /s3cr3t/*. Add s3cr3t to the end of the webpage to find the file users.txt.   
Note: to get a better understanding, look up what robots.txt is about.
